## Overview

This repository contains an implementation of a phishing detection model using a Random Forest Classifier (RFC) in Python. The model is trained to identify phishing websites based on various features and characteristics commonly associated with malicious websites.

## Features

- **Random Forest Classifier:** Utilizes the RFC algorithm for its ability to handle diverse features and provide robust performance.
- **Dataset:** Trained on a comprehensive dataset containing examples of both phishing and legitimate websites.
- **Feature Engineering:** Extracts and preprocesses relevant features from website data for effective model training.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/phishing-detection-rfc.git
