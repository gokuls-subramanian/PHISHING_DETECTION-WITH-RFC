## Overview

This repository contains an implementation of a phishing detection model using a Random Forest Classifier (RFC) in Python. The model is trained to identify phishing websites based on various features and characteristics commonly associated with malicious websites.

## Features

- **Random Forest Classifier:** Utilizes the RFC algorithm for its ability to handle diverse features and provide robust performance.
- **Dataset:** Trained on a comprehensive dataset containing examples of both phishing and legitimate websites.
- **Feature Engineering:** Extracts and preprocesses relevant features from website data for effective model training.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gokuls-subramanian/PHISHING_DETECTION-WITH-RFC
   
2. Install Dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

 ## Working
 1. Dataset Collection: Gather a diverse dataset containing features indicative of phishing and legitimate websites.

 2. Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data, extracting relevant features and preparing it for model training.

 3. Model Training: Employ a Random Forest Classifier to train the model on the preprocessed dataset for robust phishing detection.

 4. Validation and Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using validation data, ensuring accuracy, precision, and recall metrics are satisfactory.

 5. Deployment: Implement the trained model into a practical application for real-time phishing detection, enhancing cybersecurity measures.
